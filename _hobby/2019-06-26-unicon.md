Two things that I like to do are make electronics and play Super Smash Bros. with my friends.

Basically, I soldered a replacement joystick that I had lying around that was intended a gamecube controller to some perfboard and I read the two potentiometers' analog values for the X and Y directions of the stick position. In the end, it looked like this and it did work, but there was only one method of input and every time I wanted to change it, I had to change several functions in my code and modify some hardware:
