two years ago I got my parents a 3d printer for christmas because my dad has always wanted to make things when he retires, and my mom has had some entrepreneurial ideas in the past, so I thought it would be a fun hobby to design and print some 3d parts and trinkets. I got them a Monoprice Select Mini 3d Printer V2 (https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=15365), because it was the cheapest one I could find that was still a decent build volume and after watching several review videos, I was convinced that it had decent build quality as well once you configure the settings right.
Since then, they've used the printer several times, but they never really got into a rhythm with it even though they really wanted to. First of all, I haven't been around to help them troubleshoot all the issues that can come up with a 3d printer
