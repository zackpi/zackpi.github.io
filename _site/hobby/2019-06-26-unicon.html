        <p>Two things that I like to do are make electronics and play Super Smash Bros. with my friends.  Last year, when I was trying to design a robotic arm with my friend Seb, I spent a long time making a controller because I wanted to have a joystick to control it and a couple extra buttons to easily test its functionality on the fly without having to program in a bunch of commands each time we wanted to test something new. Basically, I soldered a replacement joystick that I had lying around that was intended a gamecube controller to some perfboard and I read the two potentiometersâ€™ analog values for the X and Y directions of the stick position. In the end, it looked like this and it did work, but there was only one method of input and every time I wanted to change it, I had to change several functions in my code and modify some hardware:</p>
