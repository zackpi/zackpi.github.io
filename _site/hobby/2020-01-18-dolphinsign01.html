        <p>I decided to make a cool sign for the house, and since we are calling it “Dolphin House” and our group chat generally spams a lot of the messenger dolphin emoji, I decided to just use that emoji as the model. I want the dolphin on the sign to have a 3d feel to it, so I need to determine which parts of the dolphin will be raised up and how much. I pulled the dolphin into GIMP, scaled it up, and began to create layers to show what parts of the wood will still reach that layer. So if you stacked all the layers, and took out the non-colored in parts, you should have a rough approximation of the 3d shape of the dolphin. I decided to just have 10 layers to get the general shape, then when I do the actual chiseling I can smooth between the layers as I see fit.</p>

<p>Here’s the starting dolphin, and after only 3 layers you can start to see the depth-map that it will create when you have each layer on 10% opacity:</p>

<p>And the finished depth-map of the dolphin:</p>

<p>The next step is to design the rest of the sign around the dolphin, and I want the sign to be a circular seal of sorts, something kind of classy if I can manage that.</p>

<p>Finally, I will have to pick out some wood and get a nice chisel and hammer and get to work!</p>
